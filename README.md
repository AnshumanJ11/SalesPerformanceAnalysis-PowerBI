# Sales Performance Analysis - Dashboard

## Project Overview

This dashboard aims to analyze the sales performance of a company over a span of five years from 2014-2018 at both the product and store levels. The dashboard includes key metrics presenting a comparison between the list price and the actual price over the years providing insights into the company's pricing strategies and discount trends. 

The challenge here is to present this data in a dynamic and interactive format that enables users to explore sales performance year-wise, with the ability to also drill down from a country-level overview to regional and store specific levels. The aim is to equip decision-makers with actionable insights to optimize their sales strategies, identify underperforming regions, and enhance pricing decisions.
